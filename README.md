Download Time Calculator is a PyQt5 based graphical user interface (GUI) application that calculates the estimated time it will take to download a file given the file size and download speed. The user inputs the file size and selects the appropriate unit (GB, MB, KB, or B) and download speed and select the appropriate unit (MB/s, KB/s, B/s, MBit/s, KBit/s, or Bit/s) to get the estimated download time in days, hours, minutes, hours, and seconds. If the user's not sure about their Internet Speed, there's a button to automatically determine it.
